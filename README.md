# ifr_libs
Simple libraries extracted from my other projects.

## ifr_sound.h
OpenAl abstractions, for compile you have to put `-lopenal` flag in command line, and also the library depends of `stb_vorbis.h`, but you can find STB libraries in GitHub. Is necessary to have in your machine the `OpenAL` and `alut`, the `alut` you can download in your repository system, for that is recommended to download the `freealut`.

## IfrSVG
A Lua library for interact and create SVG files. With that you can create psedo tags, patterns, and create a kind of heritage of patterns.
